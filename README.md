# Notebook Descriptions:

# EffdetLite
  -- high level training of EfficentDet Lite 
  -- made by google
# EffecientDet
  -- Uses TFOD2 (stable) to train effdetD6 as well as run inference
# FromCkpttoGraph
  -- Given a checkpoint, builds frozen graph that can be exported to tflite
# TFLiteCompression
  -- Attempt to perform full integer quantization on effDet D6
  -- TODO: train D0 and try that, EdgeTPU compile converted D6 file to determine feasibility
# Not Effective
  -- Masks_RoboTrain_Inference
